Codes of Conduct are an important part of making conferences safe for everyone
to attend. That's why I've pushed it for
[scala.io](http://scala.io/code-of-conduct.html), why I've set up one for my
office <https://github.com/companycampus/policies> and why I've publicly asked
<http://devoxx.fr> to have one.

Of course, just having a code of conduct is not enough. Conferences need to
publicize their CoCs to really make them useful.

That's why I'm taking part with Tim Chevalier, Adam Foltzer, Eric Meritt and
Chung-shieh (Ken) Shan in a challenge. There are two goals: raise **$4096** for
the Ada Initiative, and call on the ACM to publicize and implement their
anti-harassment policy in all of their conferences.


To help, you can:

- Donate to the Ada Initiative <http://supportada.org?campaign=lambda> before
  Friday, September 19, 5:00PM (Pacific Time)
- Ask the ACM to consistently publicize their Anti-Harassment Policy for all
  their conferences by tweeting something along these lines: 


> I donated to @adainitiative http://supportada.org?campaign=lambda b/c I want @theOfficialACM events to publicize their Anti Harassment Policy #lambda4ada
