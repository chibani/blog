A few days ago, I've received a promotional package from [PC soft](https://twitter.com/pcsoft_fr)
 about their platform, [Windev](http://www.windev.com/).

As you can see, WinDev is about software development.

![This is about software](/files/pcsoft/IMG_20140501_192729.jpg)

WebDev is about web development.

![Nice web design and content](/files/pcsoft/IMG_20140501_192755.jpg)

It sure looks easy to use.

What's nice it that the fairly technical content has meaningful illustrations.

![It even has a foreach loop](/files/pcsoft/IMG_20140501_193009.jpg)

It allows people to easily create relevant charts and dataviz.

Bottom line: sending me porn won't make me use your shitty platform.
