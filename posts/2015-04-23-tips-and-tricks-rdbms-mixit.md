Last week, I had the pleasure to go to Mix-IT to meet great developers and
companies, as well as to give a talk about how to design clean database
schemas. I've had great feedback on this talk, despite the fact that all my
gifs were MIA: I had to verbally describe them. Unfortunately, all this was
filmed by InfoQ, so you'll be able to see me go trough that.

It was my first time at Mix-IT and I really enjoyed it. Its medium size (~500
people) makes up for a very nice conference, with an incredibly open-minded
atmosphere. Kudos to the team!

Anyway, here are the slides:
