I'm pleased to announce that [scala.io](http://scala.io)'s CFP is now open.

## Scala.IO

[Scala.io](http://scala.io) is an annual conference hosted in **Paris**, on
**October 24th and 25th**, focused around the **Scala** language and more
broadly about **functional programming**.

Language users and library designers will meet and share experience about
scala tools and functional programming techniques used in real-world projects.

The talks will be in French or in English, depending on the speakers.

[scala.io](http://scala.io) will be an extremely interesting meetup for
anybody who wants to gain knowledge and efficiency in scala and functional
programming.

Early bird tickets will be available soon, stay tuned!

##Submit a talk

<http://scala.io/cfp.html>

We are looking for speakers willing to share their experience on building
applications with scala or any other language, following functional
programming techniques.

If you have successfully (or not, even more interesting!) applied functional
programming techniques to software projects, consider submitting a talk.

If a talk is accepted, the speakers (max. 2) will be granted free entrance to
the event.

There are 3 kinds of talks:

 - **Session** (*24 minutes*): experience report or presentation or a tool / library
   / technique, no need to try to be too technical

 - **Long session** (*42 minutes*): more in-depth talks about a specific tool /
   library / technique

 - **Workshop** (*3h*): Practical coding sessions where the attendees are supposed
   to follow on their machine. The speaker will also be able to interact with
   the attendees and to assist them if needed.

More details on the [CFP page on scala.io](http://scala.io/cfp.html).
