I gave a talk about Type-Directed Development at the [Human Talks
Nantes](http://humantalks.com/cities/nantes)

Here is the abstract:

Test-Driven Development is widely accepted as good practice. But can we do
better?  By specifying your program's behaviour with types, you can go a very
long way, with more confidence and with less hassle than with tests.

In this talk, I'll show a new vision of types, explore the fundamental
differences between specifying with types and specifying with tests. I'll talk
about how types allow us to prove properties about our program and how
genericity is a tremendously powerful tool for specification.  I'll show means
of reasoning based on types and assess specifically what it provides.

Lastly, I'll show how to complement Type-Directed Development with Test-Driven
Development to specify with tests what's left after laying out the types.
