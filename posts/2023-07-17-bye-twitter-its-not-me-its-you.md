Twitter has been an important part of my life, but I have decided to close my account. I remain active on mastodon: [@clementd@framapiaf.org](https://framapiaf.org/@clementd). I will close my account in a couple weeks, so that I can establish other communication means over DMs. 

I have joined twitter more than 15 years ago. It would be hard to overstate how the people I have met there have helped we grow. I am mostly proud of the person I am now, and twitter has played an important role in that.

A few months ago, I have almost stopped going there and switched my social media presence to mastodon. After several attempts, the Musk acquisition helped me move my primary presence. Still, I kept my account open, mostly to stay in touch with people via DMs, but also to avoid having my handle stolen. Since my account was still active, I opened it from time to time, just to keep track of what was happening.

A few weeks ago, the police murdered [Nahel Merzouk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Nahel_Merzouk) and I decided to use whatever remained of my twitter platform to amplify people protesting about police brutality. I still think it was an important thing to do, but it put and end to a multi-month twitter break and made me realize I had to actually close my account.

The next part is about French twitter, so I'll switch to French. tl;dr: for the others: there are extremely unpleasant people in the french tech twitter bubble and I don't want to interact with them more than required.

La semaine dernière, encore du harcèlement, encore par la même bande. Pas possible de me détacher de l'affaire cette fois-ci. Encore une fois, aucune conséquences pour les harceleurs, pas d'excuses. En bonus, des hypocrites se prédendant neutres qui tentent de faire taire toute critique pas assez policée. Je suis forcé de côtoyer ces gens pour le boulot, je n'ai aucune envie de m'infliger plus que ce qui est strictement nécessaire.
