Today is my last day at [Clever Cloud](https://clever-cloud.com). After five
intense years, first as a contractor, then as CTO, it's time for me to move on.

At heart, I'm a developer. Fifteen years ago in high school I've programmed my
trusty TI-82 to solve quadratic equations for me. I haven't stopped programming
then.

Nine years ago, I created my first company, before graduating from my
engineering school.  It's been nine years of entrepreneurship. A few companies,
a few failures, one big success: joining Clever Cloud. Since I've joined Clever
Cloud in 2013, the company has grown *a lot*. In people, in product, in
revenue. What hasn't changed is my mission: automating deployment processes.

Being CTO at Clever Cloud has been a great, humbling experience. I got to work
with incredible people, I had to learn almost from scratch about networking,
virtualization, kernel fine-tuning, and so much more than I can say. I also had
to learn how to be a manager, which is no easy feat for an introvert like me.
As a team, we've been through hard times, made many sacrifices, but came out
even more motivated.

From a family-like team of hard-core founders, Clever Cloud has grown into a
solid company with a stable platform and healthy management. Clever Cloud has
been family for the last five years. Now I have to pass the torch and take time
for me, my wife-to-be and our life.

Years 20-30 were all about work. For years 30+ I intend to find balance and
happiness outside my text editor.

Now it's time for me to take care of myself and go back to my roots. As a
developer.
