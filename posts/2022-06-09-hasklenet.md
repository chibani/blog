A few days ago, I thought "haha, haskle, that sounds like wordle, but for haskell".

Fast forward two days, and Iâ€™m releasing [haskle](https://haskle.net). Itâ€™s a small
wordle-like game, where the goal to guess a function from prelude given its (obfuscated)
type. The type elements are gradually revealed as you try names. Itâ€™s really fun for
functions with descriptive types (eg `ðŸ¤· ðŸ¤· => ðŸ¤· ðŸ¤· => (ðŸ¤· ->ðŸ¤· ðŸ¤·) -> ðŸ¤· ðŸ¤· -> ðŸ¤·(ðŸ¤· ðŸ¤·)`),
not so much when youâ€™re in `Floating` land. Still, Iâ€™ve learned about a lot of numeric
functions that I had never used until now.

Itâ€™s [built with elm](https://github.com/divarvel/haskle/blob/main/src/Main.elm), as I
wanted something refreshing after having used purescript extensively at `$PREVIOUS_JOB`.
Elm is fun, albeit a bit frustrating at times when youâ€™re used to haskell and purescript,
but it has be quite enjoyable overall.
